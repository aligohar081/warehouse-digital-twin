# Toy "assurance" baselines — see TRUST_LAYER.md for the honest scope of
# what these do and don't represent. There's no real hardware, no real AI
# models, and no real employees here, so each of the three actor classes
# (robot, agent, human operator) gets the simplest possible stand-in for
# the real thing, checked by backend/eval_engine.py::check_entities_valid:
#
#   robot     firmware_version must be one of APPROVED_FIRMWARE_VERSIONS
#             (backend/robot.py) — a stand-in for a real SBOM baseline.
#   AI agent  model_version must be one of APPROVED_AGENT_MODELS
#             (backend/agent.py) — a stand-in for a real Agent Assurance
#             Passport (model/tool/policy version).
#   human     certifications must include whatever CERTIFICATION_REQUIREMENTS
#             names for the task type (backend/operator.py) — a stand-in
#             for a real Worker Qualification Passport.
#
# These now gate task creation too: TaskManager.validate() (backend/
# task_manager.py) blocks a task outright — before any actor ever touches
# the work — if an explicitly-requested robot/agent/operator fails any of
# these checks, and AUTO selection (select_robot() / the agent/operator
# AUTO branches in validate()) simply skips ineligible candidates. The
# rule itself lives in one place, backend/eligibility.py, shared between
# that pre-execution gate and eval_engine.check_entities_valid's
# after-the-fact grade, so the two can't quietly disagree.
